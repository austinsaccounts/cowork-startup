### Description

This is a Mock proposal for a "co-working" client. This project should include a landing, contact, amenities and subscription pages. Ideally this project will represent the client as a a luxurious , cool high-end co-working space but still be 100% inviting and comfortable. It should Avoid the cliches of the 'big-guy' competitors. This means it should feel more natural and holisitc and not so 'corporate' and stuffy as the 'big-guys'. It should appeal to not only the 'tech' crowd but also to 
"artists, day-traders, Craftspeople, writers, counselors and traditional business people, anyone and everyone.''
